<!-- Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

Also a user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file.

If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:

Recreate the example layout.
Add images and other custom aesthetics.
Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, replace the name Dave in "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that" with the name provided by the user. -->
